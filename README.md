## Welcome to Exile Profit


### Methodology
Path of Exile is an Action RPG game created by Grind Gear Games. Within POE almost every item within the game is available to trade with other players via the POE Trade 
Website located: https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Affliction.

The currency in POE is very unique as it is also the means of which to augment and change the rolls on items.

In the images above I have taken a cluster jewel which has specific prefixes and suffixes. Which of these you want is determined by the character and build you are 
playing. 
The middle picture is called a chaos orb and this is considered as teh foundational currency in POE, similar to the American Dollar or British Pound. 

After applying the chaos orb to the items you can see the prefixes and suffixes have changed. There are many different types of currency in POE that augment items
in different ways, this document will only explain specific ones for brevity. 

This application seeks to streamline a single specific aspect of trade which is profit crafting items. Profit crafting in POE is when a play uses currency they own
to augment an base items, we will refer to them as a base, in order to sell the item to other players for more currency that the cost of the item plus the cost of 
the currency to craft the item, thus resulting in a profit.

As of this date I will only be using API data from poe.ninja because I have not been granted access to the official POE developer OAuth2 credentials.
